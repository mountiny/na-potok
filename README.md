## Website for a recreational building Na Potok

###Â Using Gatsby basic template

Other technologies used:
- TailwindCSS for making styling easier
- custom font NA POTOK
- SCSS for custom styling
- GraphCMS as a backend database storying dates of reservation

Customer did not require a reservation registration workflow since they prefer to do this over email or phone. However, they needed to show people which dates are unavailable. 

Therefore, I just used free plan of GraphCMS where they can easily add new bookings.
